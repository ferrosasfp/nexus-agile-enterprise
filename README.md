# NexusAgile

> *"The human decides WHAT. The agents execute HOW."*

You describe a feature. Claude writes code confidently, imports a module that doesn't exist, follows patterns inconsistent with your codebase, and modifies files it wasn't supposed to touch. You spend 40 minutes fixing what should have taken 10.

That's not a Claude problem. That's a structure problem.

**NexusAgile is a software development methodology built for AI agents.** It covers the full lifecycle: sprint planning, feature implementation, adversarial review, QA, and retrospectives — with specialized agents, strict gates, and zero tolerance for hallucination.

Stack-agnostic. Installs in minutes as a Claude Code skill. Works with any framework.

```
npm i  →  No.  Just copy one folder into your project.  Done.
```


## The Problem It Solves

| Problem | NexusAgile Solution |
|---|---|
| AI invents imports and modules | **Codebase Grounding** — reads real files before generating anything |
| AI creates inconsistent patterns | **Exemplar Pattern** — references existing files in your codebase |
| AI ignores restrictions | **Constraint Directives** — explicit REQUIRED / FORBIDDEN per task |
| Implementation drifted from the plan | **Drift Detection** — plan vs implementation verified in QA |
| Errors repeat across sessions | **Auto-Blindaje** — documents errors immediately when they occur |
| Context overload → hallucinations | **Sub-Agent Protocol** — each phase starts with a clean context window |
| Wrong skills loaded for the task | **Skills Router** — loads only the 1-2 skills relevant to each HU |
| Components talking in incompatible formats | **Integration Contract** — exact request/response format between components |
| No sprint visibility | **Sprint Cadence** — Planning, Status, and Retrospective built in |


## How a Sprint Works

```
⛔ SPRINT_APPROVED     ← Sprint Planning: HU list, estimates, order, branch strategy

  For each HU in the sprint:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  F0: Bootstrap + Smart Sizing + Skills Router       │
  │  F1: Work Item + EARS ACs + Scope + Dependencies    │
  │  ⛔ HU_APPROVED                                     │
  │  F2: Codebase Grounding + SDD + Adversary Review    │
  │  ⛔ SPEC_APPROVED                                   │
  │  F2.5: Story File (the only thing Dev reads)        │
  │  F3: Implementation — Waves + Anti-Hallucination    │
  │  AR: Adversarial Review — BLOCKER / MINOR / OK      │
  │  CR: Code Review — pattern compliance               │
  │  F4: QA — AC evidence file:line + quality gates     │
  │  DONE: report + _INDEX.md + issue closed            │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

⛔ REVIEW_APPROVED     ← Mid-sprint Status Meeting (optional)
⛔ RETRO_APPROVED      ← Sprint Retrospective + Closure Checklist
```

The human makes decisions at the gates. **Everything else runs automatically.**


## 3 Modes

| | FAST | LAUNCH | QUALITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Fix a bug, update a text, tweak a style | Build an MVP or prototype from scratch | Ship a feature to real users |
| **You get** | Working code in minutes | A structured codebase with anti-hallucination from day one | Full audit trail: spec, adversarial review, QA evidence |
| **Human gates** | None | One: approve the HU list | Two per HU + three sprint ceremony gates |
| **Sprint ceremonies** | No | No | Yes |
| **Speed** | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⚡⚡ | ⚡ |
| **When in doubt** | | | Use this one |


## What's New — Sub-Agent Protocol + Skills Router

Two additions that solve context overload in complex features:

### Sub-Agent Protocol

Without sub-agents, a full QUALITY pipeline accumulates context in a single session. By F4, the context window is saturated — and that's where hallucinations start.

With sub-agents, each phase starts fresh:

```
Orchestrator (minimal context — coordinates only)
     │
     ├─► [sub-agent F0]   → delivers: project-context.md + sizing
     ├─► [sub-agent F1]   → delivers: work-item.md
     │         ⛔ HU_APPROVED
     ├─► [sub-agent F2]   → delivers: sdd.md
     │         ⛔ SPEC_APPROVED
     ├─► [sub-agent F2.5] → delivers: story-file.md
     ├─► [sub-agent F3]   → delivers: code + auto-blindaje log
     ├─► [sub-agent AR]   → delivers: adversarial review report
     ├─► [sub-agent CR]   → delivers: code review report
     ├─► [sub-agent F4]   → delivers: validation.md
     └─► [sub-agent DONE] → delivers: report.md + _INDEX updated
```

The orchestrator never writes code, generates SDDs, or touches files. It coordinates, receives artifacts, and manages gates.

**Works with:** Claude Code (Task tool), OpenCode (spawned agents), or any IDE with sub-agent support. Falls back gracefully to single-session with Skills Router when sub-agents aren't available.

### Skills Router

Without a router: a monolithic `AGENTS.md` with 1000+ lines loaded on every turn — Angular patterns loaded for a Supabase migration, blockchain instructions loaded for a CSS fix.

With the Skills Router, the Architect runs a lightweight detection at F0 and loads only the 1-2 skills relevant to the current HU:

| Signal in the HU | Skill loaded |
|---|---|
| component, UI, React, layout | `skill-frontend` |
| table, migration, query, Supabase | `skill-database` |
| auth, JWT, session, permissions | `skill-auth` |
| contract, Solidity, Web3, wallet | `skill-web3` |
| endpoint, route, REST, middleware | `skill-backend` |

Max 2 domain skills per HU. More than 2 is a signal the HU is too large — split it.

Skills can come from [clawhub.com](https://clawhub.com), from a local `skills.sh` registry, or from your own project-specific skills. The router is agnostic.


## The Feature Pipeline (per HU)

### F0: Bootstrap + Smart Sizing + Skills Router

Checks for `project-context.md`. If not found, reads the codebase from scratch (dependencies, structure, patterns, commands, DB, auth) and generates it — once, reused across every session.

Classifies the HU by SDD_MODE:

| Signal | SDD_MODE |
|---|---|
| Max 2 files, no DB, no new logic | `patch` → FAST pipeline |
| Bug with reproduction steps | `bugfix` → lightweight SDD |
| Refactor or tech task | `mini` → minimal SDD |
| Feature with logic | `full` → full pipeline |

Then runs the Skills Router: detects the domain from the HU and loads only the relevant skills.

### F1: Discovery

Analyst normalizes the HU into a Work Item: objective, EARS Acceptance Criteria, Scope IN/OUT, and missing inputs. UX contributes microcopy and user flows when UI is involved. Architect analyzes dependencies and proposes execution order.

Output: `work-item.md`

Gate: `HU_APPROVED`

### F2: SDD

Deep Codebase Grounding: reads 2-3 real files related to the HU, extracts patterns (imports, naming, structure), identifies an Exemplar for every file that will be touched. Everything documented in a Context Map.

Then writes the SDD: routes, schema, UI spec, Constraint Directives (REQUIRED / FORBIDDEN), Integration Contract when components communicate, and a Readiness Check that verifies every AC has a file and every file has a valid Exemplar.

Adversary reviews the SDD before it reaches the human. No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items allowed at the gate.

Output: `sdd.md`

Gate: `SPEC_APPROVED`

### F2.5: Story File

The autocontained contract Dev reads — and **only** this document. Contains: goal in 1-2 sentences, ACs from the SDD, files to create/modify each with a real Exemplar, Integration Contract, Constraint Directives, Waves, and an Escalation Rule.

**No Story File = No coding. No exceptions.**

Output: `story-file.md`

### F3: Implementation

Dev follows the Anti-Hallucination Protocol before each task: reads the Exemplar, verifies imports exist, follows the project's patterns. No unapproved dependencies. No touching files outside Scope IN.

Work organized in Waves. W0 serial (the foundation). W1+ parallel. Before each wave, Dev re-maps: reads files created or modified in the previous wave to verify what the current wave needs actually exists. Every error documented immediately in Auto-Blindaje.

Incremental typecheck: passes after every wave. Fails → fix before continuing.

### Adversarial Review

A separate agent attacks the implementation across 8 categories: authorization, input validation, injection, secret exposure, race conditions, data exposure, mock data in production, and DB security.

BLOCKER findings must be fixed before continuing. Adversary re-reviews after each fix.

### F4: QA

Drift Detection: files created vs expected, files modified vs expected, new dependencies, files outside scope. Every AC verified with `file:line` evidence. No evidence = not done. Quality gates: typecheck + lint + build clean.

Output: `validation.md`

### DONE

## The 9 Agents

| Agent | Role | Active in |
|---|---|---|
| **Analyst** | Interprets input, normalizes into Work Item, writes EARS ACs, defines scope | F0, F1 |
| **Architect** | Codebase Grounding, Context Map, Exemplars, SDD, Story File, Code Review | F0, F1, F2, F2.5, CR |
| **UX** | Microcopy, user flows, accessibility — only when the HU has UI | F1 (UI only) |
| **Adversary** | Attacks SDD (F2) and implementation (AR) across 8 categories. Never implements. | F2, AR, CR |
| **Dev** | Reads ONLY the Story File. Implements in Waves. Anti-Hallucination Protocol always on. | F3, post-AR fixes |
| **SM** | Sprint Planning, Status Meeting, Retrospective, Sprint Closure Checklist | Sprint cadence |
| **QA** | Drift Detection, AC evidence file:line, quality gates, Validation Report | F4, CR |
| **Triage** | Evaluates if a change qualifies for FAST. Escalates if it grows beyond scope. | FAST flow |
| **Docs** | Compiles report, updates `_INDEX.md`, verifies all artifacts, closes issue | DONE |

**Separation rules:**
```
Analyst (defines)   ≠  Architect (specifies)  ≠  Dev (implements)  ≠  Adversary (attacks)  ≠  QA (validates)
```


## Gates

| Gate | Exact text | When |
|---|---|---|
| `SPRINT_APPROVED` | `SPRINT_APPROVED` | After Sprint Planning |
| `HU_APPROVED` | `HU_APPROVED` | After F1 Work Item |
| `SPEC_APPROVED` | `SPEC_APPROVED` | After F2 SDD |
| `REVIEW_APPROVED` | `REVIEW_APPROVED` | After Status Meeting |
| `RETRO_APPROVED` | `RETRO_APPROVED` | After Retrospective |

Only the exact text activates the gate. "yes", "ok", "go", "sure" do **not** activate any gate.

Between gates, the pipeline runs automatically. The agent never asks "shall I continue?" — that is a process error.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferrosasfp/NexusAgile.git /tmp/nexus-agile

**First session:**
```
NexusAgile, this is a new project. Read the codebase and generate project-context.md
```

Claude discovers: language, framework, architecture, commands, patterns. No manual setup.

**Or use it immediately on an existing project:**
```
NexusAgile, sprint planning

## Relationship with NexusFactory

```
NexusFactory  =  opinionated project template (Next.js + Supabase + Viem + Foundry)
             +   NexusAgile pre-configured (stack-aware, no bootstrap needed)

NexusAgile    =  standalone methodology (any stack, any framework)
```

NexusAgile works without NexusFactory.
NexusFactory includes NexusAgile by default.
